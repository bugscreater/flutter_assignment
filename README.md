### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todoapp
   ```

3. Download and install the required Flutter packages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Running the App

1. Start an emulator or connect a device.

2. Run the app in profile mode:
   ```bash
   flutter run --profile
   ```

### Running Integration Testing

1. Run the performance integration test:
   ```bash
   flutter drive \
     --driver=test_driver/perf_driver.dart \
     --target=integration_test/performance_test.dart \
     --profile \
     --write-sksl-on-exit=integration_test/results/performance_summary.sksl.json \
     --cache-sksl
   ```

2. To get the performance timeline, run the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter drive -t lib/main.dart --driver test_driver/main_test.dart --profile
   ```

3. The performance results will be saved in the `build` folder as `ui_timeline.timeline.json`. Open this file using [Chrome Tracing](chrome://tracing) to view the app performance report.
